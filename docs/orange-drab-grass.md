## Content that lives in your structure

* 💻 **Work with a tree hierarchy** of documents in the way that suits you

* ✍️ **The visual editor** hides technical details but leaves you in full control of formatting

* 🌐 **Build‑free publishing**: just copy the project folder to any hosting that supports static files

* 🔁 **Lossless migration**: move content to another platform without complex conversions

> **Your content — your property**\
> Skald doesn’t lock you into a platform. Your files are stored locally in standard formats (Markdown, JSON). Open formats mean freedom of choice today and content preservation tomorrow.

## ❓ Q&A

🤔 **How is Skald different from other Markdown editors?**\
Skald combines the freedom of a text editor with the discipline of structured data. You work with a tree hierarchy of documents in a visual interface, and the result — whether a local note or a public page — is always under your full control. Publishing doesn’t require a separate build process: the structure you see in the editor is the final product.

🤔 **What can you do with Skald?**\
Create and organize any tree‑structured content: from personal notes and book drafts to technical documentation and knowledge bases. Skald provides a unified space for writing, structuring, and (when needed) publishing. You can work completely offline, sync with the cloud, or instantly publish the result online — the strategy is up to you.

🤔 **How to preview a site in the browser during development?**\
There are many ways. If you’re comfortable with the command line, follow the advice from the official Vue.js website:

> To start a local HTTP server, install Node.js, then run the command `npx serve` in the project directory. You can also use any other HTTP server that supports static files with correct MIME types.

A simpler way is the program [Simple Web Server](https://simplewebserver.org). It’s free, cross‑platform, and lets you start a local server with a couple of clicks.

🤔 **Besides the file system, what storage systems does Skald work with?**\
In addition to the local file system (via the File System Access API), Skald supports any S3‑compatible cloud storage: AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, and others. When connected, data is encrypted, it supports working with multiple accounts, and access can be protected by a PIN.

In the Electron version, files are saved locally, ensuring full offline work without dependency on browser restrictions.

🤔 **Can S3 storage be used as static hosting?**\
Yes, most S3‑compatible services (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces) support static website hosting mode. Just enable the option in the bucket settings — and its contents become accessible via a public URL. Skald content can be published directly: the site becomes available online immediately without extra configuration.

🤔 **Can I use Skald offline?**\
Yes. The Electron version provides full autonomy with native file system access. The browser version also works offline after the initial cache load.

Features requiring internet (S3 sync, AI integration) are temporarily unavailable offline, but all core operations — editing, saving, navigation — function fully autonomously.

🤔 **Is it safe to add secret keys to Skald?**\
Skald applies basic security measures: keys are stored encrypted, and S3 key access can be protected by a PIN. However, since the app runs client‑side, keys are stored in your device’s local storage.

Recommendations:

* Do not use keys with unlimited permissions

* Regularly monitor their usage

* Enable local protection via a PIN

* Use keys only on trusted devices

🤔 **Which operating systems does Skald support?**\
Skald works on all major platforms:

* **Browser version**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari on Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, and mobile devices

* **Electron version**: native builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux with direct file system access

All key features are available regardless of OS and launch method.

🤔 **Which AI models does Skald support?**\
Skald integrates with the **Mistral AI** platform and supports compatible models for:

* Content generation

* Smart text and code autocomplete

* Interactive chat assistant

A valid Mistral API key is required in the settings.

🤔 **Is Node.js required to run Skald?**\
No. The editor runs entirely client‑side: Vue component compilation, Markdown processing, and site structure generation happen directly in the browser.

This lets you start working instantly — without installing dependencies, configuring environments, or running build processes.

🤔 **Was vibe coding used in developing Skald?**\
No, all code is written by hand — a deliberate architectural choice. Manual development ensures full control over logic, predictable behavior, and high maintainability.

Tech stack:

* TypeScript in strict mode (`strict: true`)

* `@vue/eslint-config-typescript` — strict typing for Vue

* `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` — detection of vulnerabilities and complex patterns

* Prettier + `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` — code formatting

* A suite of plugins for linting styles, manifests, and dependencies

🤔 **What are Skald’s shortcomings?**\
Skald prioritizes ease of development and instant feedback. Navigation for large projects happens client‑side. For most scenarios (documentation, blogs, knowledge bases) this is unnoticeable.

If you’re building a high‑traffic public portal with millions of visits, you might consider server‑rendered solutions — but then you lose simplicity and editing speed.

🤔 **What are your plans for the future?**\
We believe the word should take shape without intermediaries. Our mission is to erase the line between conception and publication, so that every person, regardless of technical skill, can easily and confidently share their ideas with the world.

Ahead lies a path toward even greater compatibility, intuitiveness, and accessibility. We strive to make publishing on the internet as natural as writing a letter: *open, write, share*. No setup, no builds, no barriers.
